Create an IA that can play a game named LiarLiar

The goal of the game is to guess if your oponant is lying or not. He choose one of his card and tell what card it is. It could be the truth or a lie. You make a bet and then if you win your oponant plays again or if you loose it's your turn to choose a card. 

The one who loose during a round collect the card chosen by the one who choosed the card. The loser keep it and put it on the table. If you have at the end 4 cards which are the same you lose.

That is quite simple!
